# BCFMC Gold Cup Festival Website [bcfmc.org]

The Bayou City Federated Music Club promotes music learning. We are a member of the National Federation of Music Clubs and the Texas Federation of Music Clubs. 500+ students participate in our festival each February and those that receive the highest grade are eligible to participate in the annual Texas State Music Festival.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
